Aspcud - A solver for package problems in CUDF format using ASP
---------------------------------------------------------------

The aspcud project provides a converter/preprocessor (cudf2lp) to translate a
CUDF specification into a set facts suitable to be processed with an ASP
grounder and solver. Furthermore, there is a small C program (aspcud) together
with a specification for the package problem (misc2012.lp or specification.lp).
It calls converter cudf2lp, grounder gringo, and solver clasp to obtain a
solution to a given CUDF document along with an optimization criterion.

To run aspcud, use the installed aspcud binary (take a look at the examples
folder):

  aspcud problem.cudf solution.cudf <criteria>

For this to work, clasp (>=2.1.3) and gringo (>=4.2.1) have to be installed.
Solver and grounder are available at:
  
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/clasp/
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/gringo/

The specification of CUDF documents and the supported criteria along with a lot
of instances are available at the mancoosi homepage:

  http://www.mancoosi.org/cudf/
  http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2012/criteria/
  http://data.mancoosi.org/misc2012/problems/

Either the encoding misc2012.lp or specification.lp can be used for solving the
package problem (can be selected with option -e). The first encoding can
typically solve harder problems than the second one. The second encoding is
often faster on simpler instance though.
